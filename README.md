# LineChart
This code demonstrate a way to build your own line chart without using any third-party library. It contains a simple yet effective algorithm to build a curved line through a set of points. I don't recommend you to import LineChart.swift directly into your project because it is build for demonstration purpose only. However, you should modify it according to your needs.
